<h1 align="center" style="font-size:72px">DOT Mine</h1>

This is a collection of, at one time, my dot files for my system. Now it
is more for small programs, I edited or created, to run my
system. This doesn't house all of them since they might prove to
hold sensitive information.


# [colorpickekr](https://github.com/Ancurio/colorpicker)

[Colorpicker](https://github.com/Ancurio/colorpicker) is a small
tool for X11 that writes the color value on your screen at the
cursor position to stdout, in RGB. I only edited the Makefile,
to install.


# [bemoji](https://github.com/marty-oehme/bemoji)
# [etc](./etc/)

houses all the files without a place, or its place doesn't
warrent its own file -- just yet.

## [githubignore](./etc/githubignore)

A simple file to put in my home directory, or any other directory I do not wish
to have git touch at all! This is an attempt to remedy my stupidity.
